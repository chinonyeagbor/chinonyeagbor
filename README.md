- 👋 Hi, I’m @chinonyeagbor
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, software development, and advancing secure, scalable solutions in tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced threat modeling, secure coding practices, data privacy compliance frameworks, and exploring the evolving role of AI in cybersecurity. As AI becomes more integral to cybersecurity, it not only helps in proactively identifying and mitigating threats but also enhances automated responses to emerging vulnerabilities
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving identity and access management (IAM), governance, risk and compliance (GRC), and innovative software security tools.
